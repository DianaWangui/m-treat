# M-TREAT Full-Stack Developer MVP

This project, **M-TREAT**, is a patient registration and authentication system built with **React**, **Redux**, **Django**, and **PostgreSQL**. The goal is to demonstrate a full-stack solution where data flows seamlessly between the frontend and backend. This README will guide you through the setup process, dependencies, and how to get the project up and running.

## Features

- **Patient Registration:** A user-friendly form where patients can register with their personal details (userame, email, phone, password). Input data is validated on both frontend and backend, and then saved into the PostgreSQL database.
- **User Authentication:** Implements token-based authentication using Djangoâ€™s authentication system. Users can log in, and their session is securely managed.
- **Patient Data Retrieval & Update:** After logging in, users can access their dashboard and update their information (excluding email). The data is fetched securely from the backend API.
